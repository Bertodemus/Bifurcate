## Bifurcate
An overhaul of my portfolio featuring my current work. The page is divided into the left side and the right side. The division represents both halves of the brain.
Left = logic & Right = Creativity

[Bifurcate Portfolio](https://bertodemus.github.io/Bifurcate/)

## Overview

* Portfolio design consists of: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `bootstrap.css`
* Bootstrap 4 was utilized to create the layout
* I created all of the illustrated elements, consisting of the flowers and my self portrait

## Application Description

* When the application is loaded for the first time, the user is met with the menu to my portfolio site

        * Each project expands to show the two sides to the project: The logic and The creativity

          * I kept everything related to design and visuals, on the right side
